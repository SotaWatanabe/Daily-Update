                <p>For better.</p>
                <p>In September, 2016. I heard something called Blockchain at the first time. On October 11th, I read WIRED vol25. The title was "Blockchain will change the world". From that time, I have never lost my passion for Blockchain. Througt a 6 months internship at SoftBank in Tokyo and a 5 months internship at Chronicled in San Francisco, I decided to devote my entire life to the better society we can make by utilizing Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence. I believe it is worth to do it because we may be able to push humankind forward thanks to these technologies. Some people may ask me "What is the society?" Good question. Currently, the amount of data is increasing 1.4 times in a year. This means it will be twice in 2 years. It is insanely great, isn't it? AI is very very good at optimaization. What do you think there is enough data in the society? What is the most optimazed society? I guess it would be an autonomous distributed society and this is what I want to make through my life.</p>
